<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Poverty&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There should be more acknowledgment of those living in poverty because around 1/3 of the world are living in this and only parts of the 2/3 of the world is actually living in this. I don' think anyone wants poverty but because the world is such a large place, it it almost impossile for the world to remain completely balanced with one another. For the furture, it is more important for people to help those in poor conditions recover. More than 3 billion people live on less than $2.50 a day. UNICEF claims "more than 22,000 people die each day due to poverty" I beilve there is hope for the future but that is only going to happen if we al contribute. I have always wanted to vistit a place like &nbsp;Uganda that is living in such a poor condition that there places that can not provide themselves with the essentials but look for the smallest natural resources that help their family and themselves. I know the economic progress is improving with organzations like Kiva and UNICEF. There are also food pantries, walk for hunger and food banks devoted for those who are asking for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why is there poverty?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is poverty in the world from many factors in the economy. Factors like weather disasters, family divorces, hunger or even low employment rates. It is diffcult to have a community or even a whole country recover when too much damage has been done. There are resolutions that will improve the place that has poverty. There are charities sheltors, counselors and more. Poverty is all around the world. 2/3 out of 1/3 are not living in the extreme part of poverty. Not many acknowledge those living in poverty.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How can charity be helped?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is an organization that my family sponsers known as Kiva. This is a place where money is donated to people who do not have enough and make their own start-up company, provide food for their family weather it is buying a goat, pig or cow.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>This is an overview of what poverty is and where the extremes of poverty are located. The world right now is stillin trying to solve this problem but it can be achieved if more people are willing to contribute in some way to a place that is still developing!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The importance of Poverty? Why did I chose this? WHo else cares?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Poverty is not just a word you can define as <em>extreme poorness.</em>&nbsp;It is a condition that can affect a small community or as much of a whole country. It is not only affecting those living in in but the whole world. Some people do not think they will ever live in povety. It is important to realize that one individal does not cause poverty. Poverty is based on the economic growth as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
